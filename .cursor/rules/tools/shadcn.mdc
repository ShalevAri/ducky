## Setting up Shadcn

To set up shadcn, run the following commands:

## Init Shadcn
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init
```

## Add all components
```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add
```

- Make sure to use the equivalent command for other package managers (such as npm, yarn or bun) if the user doesn't use pnpm
