# Ducky

A lightning-fast alternative to DuckDuckGo's bang redirects, designed for speed and efficiency.

When used as a custom search engine, Ducky provides all of DuckDuckGo's bangs (and more!)

with significantly improved performance.

## Why Ducky?

DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are processed server-side, leading to slow DNS resolution and redirect times.

Ducky solves this by handling all redirects client-side, resulting in near-instantaneous navigation.

## Features

### Bang Commands

- Full support for all DuckDuckGo bangs
- Client-side processing for faster redirects
- Zero server latency

### Ducky Islands

Custom prompt prefixes for AI bangs:

```bash
!t3   # Search regularly in T3 Chat
!t3a  # Injects a prompt to prioritize direct answers (for when you need a quick answer instead of a wall of text)
```

### Ducklings

Automatic pattern-based redirects without typing bang commands:

```bash
# Pattern: shalevari/ducky
# Bang: !ghr
typing 'shalevari/ducky' â†’ automatically redirects to this GitHub repository
```

## Installation

### npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShalevAri/ducky.git
cd ducky
npm install
npm run dev
```

### yarn

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShalevAri/ducky.git
cd ducky
yarn install
yarn dev
```

### pnpm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShalevAri/ducky.git
cd ducky

```

### bun

```

### Add Ducky to your browser:

- Add `http://localhost:49152?q=%s` as a custom search engine in your browser

## Configuration

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed redirect timing information:

1. Either open `http://localhost:49152` or type `duckylocal` to open it automatically
2. Add `DEBUG_MODE: true` to localStorage
3. Open the console and navigate to any website, you should now see debug information

### LocalStorage Options

```javascript
{
  "DEBUG_MODE": true/false,           // Enable/disable debug mode
  "DISABLE_LOADING_PAGE": true/false, // Disable the loading page
  "default-bang": "string"           // Set the default search engine to use
}
```

### Port Configuration

The default port is `49152`, you can change it by editing the `vite.config.ts` file
