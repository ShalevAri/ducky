# 🦆 Ducky

A lightning-fast alternative to DuckDuckGo's bang redirects, designed for speed and efficiency.

When used as a custom search engine, Ducky provides all of DuckDuckGo's bangs (and more!)

with significantly improved performance.

# 🚧 Maintenance Mode

Ducky is currently in maintenance mode.

No new features will be developed, I'm currently focusing on fixing bugs, refactoring code, improving performance, etc.

## 🚀 Why Ducky?

DuckDuckGo's bang redirects are processed server-side, leading to slow DNS resolution and redirect times.

Ducky solves this by handling all redirects client-side, resulting in near-instantaneous navigation.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Bang Commands

- Full support for all DuckDuckGo bangs
- Client-side processing for faster redirects
- Zero server latency

### 🏝️ Ducky Islands

Custom prompt prefixes for AI bangs:

```bash
!t3   # Search regularly in T3 Chat
!t3a  # Injects a prompt to prioritize direct answers (for when you need a quick answer instead of a wall of text)
```

### 🐥 Ducklings

Automatic pattern-based redirects without typing bang commands:

```bash
# Pattern: shalevari/ducky
# Bang: !ghr
typing 'shalevari/ducky' → automatically redirects to this GitHub repository
```

### 🔍 Super Cache

Super Cache allows Ducky to cache recent search results, so you don't have to wait for the redirect.

The default redirect speed is already very fast, but this may improve it even more.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShalevAri/ducky.git
cd ducky
npm install
npm run dev
```

### yarn

yarn dev
```

### pnpm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShalevAri/ducky.git
cd ducky
pnpm install
pnpm dev

### 🔍 Add Ducky to your browser:

- Add `http://localhost:49152?q=%s` as a custom search engine in your browser

## 🛠️ Configuration

### 🐛 Debug Mode

Enable detailed redirect timing information:

1. Either open `http://localhost:49152` or type `duckylocal` to open it automatically
2. Add `DEBUG_MODE: true` to localStorage
3. Open the console and navigate to any website, you should now see debug information

### 🔧 LocalStorage Options

```javascript
{
  "DEBUG_MODE": true/false,           // Enable/disable Debug Mode
  "SUPER_CACHE": true/false,          // Enable/disable Super Cache
  "DISABLE_LOADING_PAGE": true/false, // Disable the loading page
  "default-bang": "string"           // Set the default search engine to use
}
```

### 📡 Port Configuration

The default port is `49152`, you can change it by editing the `vite.config.ts` file
